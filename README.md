# 🔍 Subdomain Enumeration Tool

This tool is a simple Bash script that performs passive subdomain enumeration and checks for live subdomains of a given domain. It also supports automatically pushing the results to a GitHub repository.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 Find subdomains using:
  - `subfinder`
  - `amass`
- 🌐 Check which subdomains are live using:
  - `httpx`
- 📄 Save all and live subdomains to separate files
- 🐙 Push the results to a GitHub repository (optional)

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Give the script execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x find-live-subs.sh
````

### 2. Run the script:

```bash
./find-live-subs.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter a domain:

```
Enter domain: example.com
```

Then it will:

* Find subdomains
* Check for live ones
* Display both lists
* Ask if you want to upload results to GitHub

---

## 📁 Output

The script creates a directory like this:

```
example.com_recon/
├── all_subdomains.txt      # All subdomains found
├── live_subdomains.txt     # Only the live subdomains
└── README.md               # This README file
```

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system PATH:

* [`subfinder`](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
* [`amass`](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass)
* [`httpx`](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
* `git`

Install via Go:

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v3/...@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
```

Add Go binaries to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

---

## 📤 GitHub Upload (Optional)

At the end of the script, you will be prompted:

```
Do you want to push this to GitHub? (y/n):
```

If you choose **yes**, make sure:

* You have replaced `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>` in the script with your real repo URL
* Your Git authentication is set up (SSH or HTTPS with PAT)
